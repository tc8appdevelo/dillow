* Features

* Listings:

The listings are displayed in a scrolling view with their pictures and their price, city, state, zip code, lot size, and amount of bedrooms and bathrooms.  When a logged in user creates a new listing, it is added to the listings shown.  Clicking on a listing brings up a modal that shows more details about that listing along with its expanded pictures.

* Map:

Google maps renders on the page next to the listings scrolling view. The map should render pins representing the locations of the listings in the scrolling view.

* Profile:

If you are signed in, you can navigate to your profile page.  Signed in users also have the option to create new listings.  If you are signed in, you can save a listing and that listing will appear in your saved listings page.  

* Search:

Users should be able to search for homes based on a city or zip code entered into the map search bar.
